# BICL Project

The BICL project seeks to use bio-inspired algorithms to further the classification, inference, and semantic capturing capabilities of machine learning technology. A focus on unsupervised and semi-supervised learning as well as sparse-distributed data representations are the cornerstones of the research and will ensure the algorithm has robustness to noise and can independently learn and process real-time data. Working mainly in Python 2 and 3.

My (Mark Musil's) contributions to the project are described below. Each project's source code can be found in this repository along with documentation.

## Personal Contributions

### SparseVecs

Python application for processing an adjacency matrix, creating sparse representations
for each vertex, and representations edges by creating vectors for each row
which are the concatenation of the sparse representations for each vertex.
Created for the purposes of the BICL research group led by Dr. Dan Hammerstrom.
