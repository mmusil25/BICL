# Corgraph Project

The Corgraph project seeks to use bio-inspired algorithms to further the classification, inference, and semantic capturing capabilities of machine learning technology. A focus on unsupervised and semi-supervised learning as well as sparse-distributed data representations are the cornerstones of the research and will ensure the algorithm has robustness to noise and can independently learn and process real-time data. Working mainly in Python 2 and 3.

My (Mark Musil's) contributions to the project are described in the following section. These can all be found in this repository along with their own documentation.
