**Dendritic Layer Project**

As my undergraduate honor's thesis, I created a fully connected layer that uses
a more completed model of the neuron - specifically a transfer function for dendritic activation. This 
fully connected layer will then be integrated into a larger CNN and evaluated on the MNIST handwritten
digit dataset.
