# Vectorized Self Organizing Map Version 1

This program seeks to create a self organizing map (SOM) which 
shares properties with the spatial pooler invented by Numenta. 
It is meant to simulate feedforward behavior of a single cortical
layer in the mammalian brain. It inherits all properties of a SOM
while also implementing local receptive fields, a K-winners
take all global learning rule, and a local winner takes all
learning rule.

This program was built off of the tensorflow SOM created by 
[Sachin Jogkelar](https://codesachin.wordpress.com/). The additional
work was performed by Mark Musil.
