## Cortical Vision

In this work two neural inspired
algorithms are combined. A
convolutional neural network
which performs well on image
recognition tasks and Numenta's spatial
pooler which is an unsupervised
algorithm meant to capture statistical
information in the same way as the
neocortex. The goal is to demonstrate
that similar image inputs to the system
create similar yet distinct outputs at the
highest SP layer.
